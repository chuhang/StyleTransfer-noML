## Requirements:
- Matlab (developed & tested on R2016b)
- Computer Vision Toolbox

## Usage:
### 1. Run the demo

```
run_demo.m
```

We saved AMAT result in data.mat and data2.mat. This demo does not use Image Quilting.

### 2. Get all dependencies

- Get AMAT from [AMAT](https://github.com/tsogkas/amat)
- Get Image Quilting from [ImageQuilting](https://github.com/PJunhyuk/ImageQuilting)
